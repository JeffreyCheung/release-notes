==== AppArmor not available by default

Since AppArmor is no longer available in SUSE Linux Enterprise 16.0+, users can no longer choose AppArmor as the Linux Security Module (LSM) during the installation. Limited AppArmor functionality can be enabled post-installation. All necessary steps are described in https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:AppArmor#Switching_from_SELinux_to_AppArmor_for_Leap_16.0_and_Tumbleweed[the AppArmor wiki page].
