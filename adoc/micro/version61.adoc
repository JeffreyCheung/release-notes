== {this-version}

These release notes apply to {productname} {this-version}.

=== Changes affecting all architectures

==== Password-based remote root login not allowed

For enhanced security, new installations of {productname} {this-version} do not allow password-based remote root login anymore, which also affects Cockpit.
The login to Cockpit now requires to create and use an unprivileged user and to optionally set up 2-factor authentication with one-time passwords.
The `firstboot-installer` as well as `ignition` and the online tool `fuel-ignition` support this setup.
